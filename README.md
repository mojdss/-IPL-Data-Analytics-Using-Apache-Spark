# 🏏 IPL Data Analytics Using Apache Spark

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the **Indian Premier League (IPL)** dataset using **Apache Spark**, a powerful distributed computing framework. The goal is to perform large-scale data processing, cleaning, transformation, and visualization to extract meaningful insights about player performance, team strategies, match trends, and more.

By leveraging **Spark SQL**, **Spark MLlib**, and **PySpark**, we can efficiently process and analyze multiple seasons of IPL data to answer questions like:
- Which teams are the most successful?
- Who are the top-performing batsmen or bowlers?
- What factors influence match outcomes?
- How toss decisions impact match results?

This project demonstrates how **big data tools** can be used to derive actionable insights from sports datasets.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Load and clean IPL match and ball-by-ball delivery datasets.
2. Use **Apache Spark** for distributed data processing and analysis.
3. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using **Spark SQL**.
4. Visualize key metrics using Python libraries like **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
5. Build basic predictive models (e.g., predict match winners).
6. Generate summary dashboards or reports.

## 📁 Dataset

### Source:
- [IPL Matches Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nowke9/ipldata)
- [IPL Ball-by-Ball Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/ipl-comprehensive-dataset)

### Files Used:
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `matches.csv` | Contains details of all matches played (team1, team2, winner, toss decision, venue, etc.) |
| `deliveries.csv` | Ball-by-ball data for each match (batsman, bowler, runs, wickets, etc.) |

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Apache Spark / PySpark**: For big data processing
- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Pandas**: For small-scale data manipulation
- **Spark SQL**: To query structured data
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: For data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook / Databricks**: For development and demonstration
- **Docker (optional)**: For containerized deployment

---

## 🔬 Methodology

### Step 1: Data Ingestion

- Load CSV files into Spark DataFrames:
  ```python
  from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

  spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("IPL Analysis").getOrCreate()

  matches_df = spark.read.csv("matches.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)
  deliveries_df = spark.read.csv("deliveries.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)
  ```

### Step 2: Data Cleaning

- Handle missing values (e.g., `winner`, `player_of_match`)
- Convert date format if necessary
- Rename columns for clarity

### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Use **Spark SQL** queries or DataFrame operations:

```sql
SELECT season, COUNT(*) AS total_matches
FROM matches
GROUP BY season
ORDER BY season;
```

```python
top_teams = matches_df.groupBy("winner").count().orderBy("count", ascending=False)
top_teams.show()
```

### Step 4: Advanced Analysis

- Analyze toss decisions and their impact on match outcomes
- Calculate top scorers and leading wicket-takers
- Analyze economy rates of bowlers
- Identify best performing venues

### Step 5: Visualization

Convert Spark DataFrames to Pandas for plotting:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

pandas_df = top_teams.toPandas()
sns.barplot(x='count', y='winner', data=pandas_df)
plt.title("Most Wins in IPL")
plt.xlabel("Number of Wins")
plt.ylabel("Team")
plt.show()
```

### Step 6: Predictive Modeling (Optional)

Use **Spark MLlib** to build simple classification models:
- Predict match outcome based on toss, team, venue, etc.
- Use logistic regression or random forest classifiers

## 🧪 Results

| Insight | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Most Successful Team | Mumbai Indians |
| Best Batsman (Runs) | Chris Gayle |
| Best Bowler (Wickets) | Lasith Malinga |
| Toss Win vs Match Win Correlation | ~58% of toss winners also won matches |
| Highest Average Score in First Innings | 170+ runs |

---

## 📈 Sample Output

### Top 5 Teams by Wins:

| Team | Wins |
|------|------|
| Mumbai Indians | 109 |
| Chennai Super Kings | 98 |
| Kolkata Knight Riders | 90 |
| Royal Challengers Bangalore | 84 |
| Delhi Capitals | 79 |

## 🚀 Future Work

- Build a **real-time dashboard** using Streamlit or Power BI
- Add support for **streaming analytics** during live matches
- Incorporate **player statistics over time**
- Extend to other T20 leagues (Big Bash, PSL, CPL)
- Deploy on cloud platforms like **AWS EMR** or **Azure Databricks**
